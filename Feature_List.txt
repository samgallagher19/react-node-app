List of features needed for a good bugtracker:

Before tackling the following list:

1) Need to have a page to render all details of one issue
	- Research how to route different pages in React.

1) A short description of the problem or feature request (the title)

2) Room for an extended description

3) The ability to attach files/images (screenshots)
	- Research how to store files and images on a database.

4) The ability to prioritize bugs/features

5) The ability to categorize entries as bugs, features, inquiry, etc.

6) The ability to assign bugs/features to areas (UI, database, documentation, etc.)

7) The ability to assign bugs/features to products (we track bugs on five products)

8) The ability to assign bugs/features to releases ("to be fixed in version 5.1")

9) The ability to assign bugs/features to people (developers/writers)

10) The ability to assign bugs/features to customers (reporters)

11) The ability to re-assign to a different person (developer)

12) The ability to Resolve bugs/features (mark them as finished and ready for testing)

13) The ability to mark resolution status (fixed, won't fix, can't reproduce, etc.)

14) The ability to Close bugs/features (take them off list after resolution & testing)

15) The ability to Reopen bugs/features (restore to "Open" if testing fails)

16) The ability to inform customers the bug has been resolved (e.g. via email)

17) Date and Time stamp on every step (Open, Resolve, Close, Re-open)

18) The ability to report on the number of Open bugs! (how close to release are we?)

19) The ability to show bug reports versus resolutions

20) The ability to search on bugs/features by date, priority, product, person, etc.

21) The ability to list and sort bugs for easy scanning!
